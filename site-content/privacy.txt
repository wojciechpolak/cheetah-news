<h2>Cheetah News Privacy Policy</h2>

<ol>

<li>PURPOSE
  <p>This chapter describes storage and processing of <dfn>User
      Private Data</dfn> by Cheetah News Service.</p>
</li>

<li>INFORMATION GATHERING AND USAGE
  <ul style="margin-top:1.2em; margin-bottom:1em;">
    <li>In order to provide the service, Cheetah News needs to store
      and maintain some information, provided by the user. Such
      information, hereinafter referred to as <dfn>user personal
	data</dfn> (or <dfn>user data</dfn> for short), includes, but
      is not limited to, user e-mail address, user's subscriptions
      and notes.</li>
      
    <li>User e-mail address is used in conjunction with his password
      in order to authenticate the user.</li>

    <li>When the user signs in to access his service, his personal
      data are transferred via an encrypted SSL channel, which makes
      their interception by third parties extremely improbable.</li>

    <li>Cheetah News will never sell, rent, or otherwise make public
      any personal information, obtained from the user.</li>

    <li>User e-mail address will not be used for any other purpose
      except as a means of authentication and for communicating
      urgent and/or important information as stated in section
      `<a href="#CHANGES">CHANGES</a>' of this document and in
      section `<a href="terms_of_service#expiration">ACCOUNT TERMS</a>' of
      Terms of Service.</li> 
  </ul>
</li>

<li>RETENTION OF PERSONAL DATA
  <p>Cheetah News will retain user personal data for as long as it is
    needed to provide a proper service to the user.</p>
</li>

<li>USER DATA STORAGE
  <p>All user data is stored on Cheetah News machines.  While the
    Cheetah News Team owns the storage itself, the user retains all
    rights to his data.</p>
</li>

<li>COOKIES
  <p>A <dfn>cookie</dfn> is a means of recording information about
    user sessions in order to recover their state.  It consists of a
    small amount of data that is generated by Cheetah News,
    transferred to the user's browser and stored on the user's
    computer.  Use of cookies is required for proper
    functioning of Cheetah News Service.</p>
</li>    

<li><a name="CHANGES">CHANGES</a>
  <p>Cheetah News Team reserves the right to periodically revise and
    update this Privacy Policy, retaining its main principle about
    non-distribution of user private data.  All Cheetah News users
    will be notified about any such changes, by sending a notice to
    the e-mail address provided by the user when registering, or by
    placing a prominent notice on the main page of the service.</p>
</li>
	 
<li>QUESTIONS
  <p>All questions regarding this Policy should be directed to
    <a href="mailto:cheetah-admins@gnu.org.ua">cheetah-admins@gnu.org.ua</a>.</p>
