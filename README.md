Cheetah News
============

Cheetah News was a free web-based personal news aggregator, capable of
reading Atom and RSS feeds online. It was founded in July 2005 by
Wojciech Polak as a pet project and operated online between years 2005
and 2022. However, its active development was only performed in the
first three years. After that, only some small changes and fixes were
applied. It was finally shut down in 2022 and moved to a public repo
to preserve its source code.

This project was primarily written in JavaScript (mostly Vanilla JS),
XSLT (running in the browser), HTML, CSS, PHP (backend), MySQL, and
with some little help of Scheme and C. It was a single-page
application (SPA) using Ajax, from day one. Oh, and of course,
Emacs was used as an IDE.
